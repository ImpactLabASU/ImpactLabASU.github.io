            Submission Guidelines
        </h2>
        <p>
            We invite submissions of anonymized short papers of up to 6 pages, excluding references. Submissions should adhere to the WACV paper template (<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/wacv-2025-author-kit-template/zfydvwqrjmsb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overleaf template</span></a>). Ensure your paper is accessible to readers who are not experts in your specific area of medicine; avoid jargon when possible or provide clear definitions for specialized terms. Submissions must be anonymized for a double-blind review process. References do not count toward the 6-page limit and can be included beyond the main content. Please note that submissions not adhering to the specified format may be desk rejected at the discretion of the workshop organizers.
            The review process is double-blind, ensuring both authors and reviewers remain anonymous. All authors must be registered at the time of submission, and no authors can be added after the review process has begun. As this workshop is non-archival, we will consider papers containing content previously published in other venues (e.g., medical journals). However, such papers may need to be rewritten to align with the workshop's format and audience expectations.
            Please make sure your submission matches these guidelines so that you can go ahead and go through a smooth review process. We look forward to receiving your contributions!

        <h3>
            Code sharing & reproducibility guidance
        </h3>

        <p>
             While we do not enforce it, we will highlight submissions containing documented code and reproducible workflows.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Double-submission policy
        </h3>
        <p>
             While we primarily encourage submitting original work, we also accept submissions that are versions of already published work if their topic fits particularly well with the workshop's scope. In contrast, with the objective of respecting the hard work of reviewers and giving equal chances to all submissions, we strictly prohibit submitting to multiple workshops simultaneously. Submissions flagged as coincidentally submitted to multiple WACV workshops will be desk rejected.
        </p>
